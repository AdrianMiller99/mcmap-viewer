# mcmap-viewer

Pixel-perfect Minecraft world map web viewer.

## About

This is the web frontend for a Minecraft world map renderer. It displays a daily-rendered
map of a Minecraft server world with **pixel-perfect, no-interpolation rendering** - 
preserving the crisp pixel-art aesthetic of Minecraft.

## Features

- **Pixel-perfect scaling** - Uses `image-rendering: pixelated` for crisp zoom
- **Pan & zoom** - Leaflet-based viewer with smooth navigation
- **Daily updates** - Map image is refreshed daily via automated pipeline
- **Mobile-friendly** - Works on desktop and mobile browsers

## Updating

The map image (`map.png`) is generated by the render pipeline and should not be
committed to this repo. To update:

```bash
# Pull latest web viewer changes
git pull

# Map image is generated separately by the render script
```

## Tech Stack

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - Interactive map library
- Vanilla JavaScript - No framework needed
- CSS with pixel-perfect rendering
